  <h2>3 Day Itinerary</h2>
  <p>When visiting Tokyo, you could stay for a lifetime and still not explore the entire city. However, even with just 3 days, you'll have ample time to see some of the greatest parts local Tokyo has to offer. This itinerary aims to highlight the must-visit spots while suggesting which overrated places you can skip.</p>

<h3>Day 1</h3>
<h3>East Tokyo</h3>
<h3>Asakusa</h3>
<h4>Approximate Time for Sightseeing: 3-4 hours</h4>
<p>Asakusa has been a prominent center of culture and entertainment since the Edo period (1603-1868). The area flourished as a temple town and later became a hub for theater and performing arts. Despite suffering damage during World War II, Asakusa has retained its historical charm and continues to be a cultural landmark.</p>
<p>When you reach the entrance to Asakusa, take a photo of the famous Kaminarimon red lantern, dedicated to the god of thunder Raijin, the protector of temple grounds from evil. As you walk down the narrow street called Nakamise-dori, do some window shopping and buy a snack if you are hungry. At the end of the path will be Sensoji Temple, founded in 628 AD to the Kannon Goddess. While there, you can try and inspect your fortune called Omikuji for a small fee. Afterwards, find a place to eat as there are many choices in the area.</p>
<h4>Other Mentions</h4>
<p>If you plan to visit various temples in Japan, consider getting a Goshūinchō (御朱印帳), which are unique stamps and calligraphy given by the temple or shrine as a record of the visit.Their main purpose to collect Goshūin, which serve as both a keepsake and a proof of visit to a particular religious site. They typically have a hardcover with beautiful, often traditional designs, and contains accordion-style folded pages to accommodate the stamps and calligraphy. They are also fun to collect!</p>

<h3>Ueno and Tokyo Museum</h3>
<h4>Approximate Time for Sightseeing: 4-6 hours</h4>
<p>After visiting Asakusa, head to Ueno. Ueno is a vibrant district in Tokyo known for its cultural attractions and beautiful park. The area is home to several museums, a zoo, and a variety of seasonal events. Ueno Park, established in 1873, is one of Japan's oldest public parks and a popular spot for cherry blossom viewing in the spring.</p>
<p>Start your visit at Ueno Park, where you can stroll through lush greenery and enjoy the serene atmosphere. The park hosts numerous events throughout the year, so be on the lookout for local festivals, art exhibitions, and yatai (food stalls) offering delicious Japanese street food. A must-see in Ueno is the Tokyo National Museum, the largest national museum in Japan, which houses an extensive collection of art and artifacts from Japan and other Asian countries.</p>
<p>Other notable attractions in Ueno include the Ueno Zoo, which is Japan's oldest zoo and home to a variety of animals, including the famous giant pandas. For art enthusiasts, the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum and the National Museum of Western Art are also located within the park.</p>

<h3>Honorable Mentions</h3>

The walk from the entrance through the forest to the shrine is a calming experience, making it a perfect spot for reflection and relaxation.</p>



  <h2>5 Day Itinerary</h2>
  <p>With 5 days, you give yourself more breathing space to visit the outskirts of Tokyo that outshine even the inner parts of the city. These trips generally take a full day, but there is enough time to depart from Tokyo and return if your lodging happens to be in Tokyo.</p>

  <h2>7+ Day Itinerary</h2>
  <p>There is no limit to the things you can do from Tokyo. If you give yourself 7 or more days, you now have the chance to venture even further to places that local Tokyoites would go. These trips would entail a overnight stay, so prepare to make accomodation elsewhere for a day or two.</p>
